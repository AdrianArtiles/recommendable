=== TODO

* Ensure correct privacy levels for methods. How can I do this and keep using
  the methods from outside of the class?

=== Next update

* Implement a sort of "save for later" option. Hides from recommendations, but
  accesible through a model and not hidden around the site elsewhere.
  Recommendable::SavedItem, perhaps?
* Allow the option of common_likes_with and common_dislikes_with to return the
  actual objects so users get more use out of this
* Allow the option NOT to queue up on like/dislike/ignore?
